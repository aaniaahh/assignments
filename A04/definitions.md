## Definitions:

**Abstract Classes:**
In object-oriented programming, a class designed only as a parent from which sub-classes MAY be derived, but which is not itself suitable for instantiation. Often used to "abstract out" incomplete sets of features which may then be shared by a group of sibling sub-classes which add different variations of the missing pieces.


**Abstraction:**
The process of hiding implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It simplifies complexity by providing a clear interface.


**Access Modifiers:**
 A keyword that determines the visibility or accessibility of a class, method, variable, or other members in object-oriented programming. It controls where and how a particular class or member can be accessed, either within the same class, subclass, or from other classes or packages.

**Attributes:**
Characteristics of an object, often represented as class variables.


**Class Variable:**
A variable that is shared among all instances of a class. Defined using the * *static* * keyword in many programming languages.
