## P02C - Knucklebones

The game KnuckleBones is a simple dice game that is played between two players on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to place dice on the grid and score more points than your opponent by following a few key rules.

### Here are brief breakdowns of the rules:
1. Two Players: The game is played between two players, each with their own 3x3 grid.

2. Dice Rolling: Each turn, a player rolls a six-sided die.

3. Placing Dice: The player then places the die in one of the three columns on their grid.
+ A player can place a die in any of the three columns, and dice stack vertically in each column.

4. Scoring Rules:
+ The player's score is the sum of the dice in each column.

+ Multiplication Bonus: If a player places multiple dice with the same value in the same column, their values are multiplied together.

5. Opponent's Dice Removal: If a player places a die in a column that matches one of their opponent's dice in the same column, the opponent's matching die is removed from their grid.

6. End of Game: The game ends when all 9 spaces in both players' grids are filled. The player with the highest score wins.
