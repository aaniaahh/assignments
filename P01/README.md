# P01 - Fraction Class

## Overview

This project serves as a practical introduction to building an object-oriented code. This project involves creating a **Fraction class** in C++ that models mathematical fractions and allows basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and comparison using operator overloading. The objective is to implement the class in a structured way by separating the **class definition** (header file) and **class implementation** (source file). The project will also emphasize key programming principles. 

I will also show the importance of maintaining proper class invariants, such as ensuring the fraction is always in its reduced form (and never zero).
