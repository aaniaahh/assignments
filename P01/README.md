# P01 - Fraction Class

## Overview

This project serves as a practical introduction to building an object-oriented code. This project involves creating a **Fraction class** in C++ that models mathematical fractions and allows basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and comparison using operator overloading. The objective is to implement the class in a structured way by separating the **class definition** (header file) and **class implementation** (source file). The project will also emphasize key programming principles. 

I will also show the importance of maintaining proper class invariants, such as ensuring the fraction is always in its reduced form (and never zero).

### Files Used:

 File            : Description                         

[Fraction.cpp](https://github.com/aaniaahh/OOP/blob/main/assignments/P01/Fraction.cpp) : 
A defined version of the header file (class). 

[Fraction.h](https://github.com/aaniaahh/OOP/blob/main/assignments/P01/Fraction.h) :
The declarations for my Fraction class. 

[input.txt](https://github.com/aaniaahh/OOP/blob/main/assignments/P01/input.txt) :
A file to store data into the program can read and process during execution. 

[main.cpp](https://github.com/aaniaahh/OOP/blob/main/assignments/P01/main.cpp) :
Main driver that preforms the fraction algorithms called.
